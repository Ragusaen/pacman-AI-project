Scrips for the assignment of creating a planning/rl agent for Pacman. Taken from an assignment at (https://ai.berkeley.edu/project_overview.html)

To run the game use: 

`python pacman.py -p PlanningAgent -l mediumGrid `
or
`python pacman.py -p PlanningAgent -l bigGrid`

The code of the planning agent is in the file planningAgent.py. Please, rename the agent to give it the name you want (simply by changing the name of the class).

Any questions, contact alto@cs.aau.dk
